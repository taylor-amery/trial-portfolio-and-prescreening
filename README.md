# Clinical Trial Matching Prescreening Tool

## Overview

This is a simple prescreening tool designed to quickly assess potential research candidates based on predefined criteria. 
Users select relevant qualifications, and the tool provides immediate feedback on potential eligibility based on these predefined criteria.
The template is geared toward prostate cancer trials and therapies, and is only concerned with prior therapies a person has had. 
It could easily be updated to collect, and match for, more detailed information relating to trial eligibility.
